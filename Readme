Define a function calculateTip():

In JavaScript, define a function named calculateTip() that will handle the calculation logic.
This function will take the user inputs, perform calculations, and update the result display area with the calculated values.
Retrieve values from input fields using document.getElementById():

Use document.getElementById() to retrieve the values entered by the user from the input fields.
Assign these values to variables to be used in the calculation process.
For example, retrieve the bill amount, service rating, number of people, and meal type.
Perform necessary calculations based on the service rating and meal type:

Based on the service rating selected by the user, calculate the tip amount.
Use a conditional statement (such as a switch case) to determine the appropriate tip percentage based on the service rating.
Similarly, consider the meal type (e.g., dinner) and apply any additional adjustments to the tip amount if necessary.
Update the result display area with the calculated values:

Once the tip amount, total amount, and amount per person are calculated, update the corresponding elements in the HTML to display these values.
Use textContent property to set the text content of the result display area elements with the calculated values.
Attach an event listener to the calculate button:

Select the calculate button element using document.getElementById() or another suitable method.
Use the addEventListener() method to attach an event listener to the calculate button.
Specify the event (e.g., "click") and the function to be called (i.e., calculateTip()) when the event is triggered.
